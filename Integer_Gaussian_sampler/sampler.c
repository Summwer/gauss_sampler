 * ctx : Pointer to the sampler_context structure, including PRNG or other.
 * ********************************************************************************************
 * Please read the following precautions carefully!!!!
 * 1. In supplied folder "example/sampler", it offers a falcon's sampler as an instance for giving the codes about pointer "ctx".
 * 2. In folder "example/sampler", it includes the implementation of SHAKE256 in shake.c and PRNG in rng.c, please just use it.
 * 3. In the head file "example/sampler/sampler.h", it gives the definition of "ctx" in the struct "sampler_context", please just use it and don't change it.
 * 4. In the main file "example/sampler/main.c", it provides the procedure of how to initialize the pointer ctx, you should learn it and use it.
 * 5. The API of sampler function in the "example/sampler" is similar to ours. Pointer ctx is the same and fpr also denotes the type of "double", but we use "double" here.
 *
 *
 *In conclusion, you should use the method of defining and initializing for pointer ctx in given "example/sampler",
 *please don't change it and just use it. You should focus on the four samplers themselves. Pointer ctx should be the same for everyone.
